## Relationships

### Field Level Relationships

IceburgCRM supports field level relationships.   A field level relationship could be a state field in an accounts module.  When added or searching you would select the value from the dropdown.

In the database, the ID of the related module and field is stored.  When you export module or relationship data IceburgCRM substitutes the ids for the value in the related module.  When you import the reverse process happens.
For example:   If you had a related State field and had the Alabama saved.  In the database you would see 1 in the accounts tables record.  In the ice_fields you would see that this field is a related type pointing to module with the id 17 (States module id is 17) and field id 2 (2nd field is the value field). 
When you export by default you will be Alabama and when you import Alabama is replaced with 1 again.


### Module Level Relationships

IceburgCRM supports Unlimited relationships between modules.

A typical CRM has a two way relationship between two modules.  For example Accounts have many contacts and contacts can have many accounts.

IceburgCRM allows you to create relationships between 2, 3, 4 or more modules.

Why would you need a relationship between more than 2 modules?
Let's say you wanted to have a subpanel that stored when a contract was signed, who signed, what location.  A typical CRM will duplicate data or create new fields (that sit empty for all of the other records) or find some awkward method to force the data into a two way relationship.

IceburgCRM allows you to relate a Contract module, Account module, Contact module, City module, State module, Country module without having to add a related field or worse a free text field.

You can have multiple relationships and use them to create multiple subpanels for modules.  For example you may want an Account & Contact subpanel but you may also want an Account Contact Opportunity subpanel.

You would use a relationship for a subpanel and then select the fields you want from any module.


A contract module could have a relationship to an account, a contact, a location

```
tel
currency
checkbox
password
image
video
audio
file
number
email
url
zip
date
related
address

color
radio
text
```
_Try the Color field type.  It will present a color picker._

## Calender

Fully customizable including colors and event hooks.  You can select, day, week or month for the calendar view.  The meetings module holds the data that powers the calendar.  Allows multiple appointments at the same time.  Click on an event to generate a popup.

## Datalets

Datalets are frontpage widgets.  They can take the form of a graph, table, or video or anything.  In the default IceburgCRM we provide a number of different graphs.  In the AI generated CRMs we provide information base datalets.

Adding your own is easy.  Add the datalet to the datalets table, add your new data function in the backend and create your vue template. 

## Workflow - Confortable Modules
You can setup a workflow between modules.  A stage box will appear in the module detail screen showing you at what stage this record is in the workflow.  It also allows you to select other records in the workflow to examine what happened previously or later in the chain. 

There a 5 module workflow setup in the default IceburgCRM.  You can modify the workflow in the seeding files or in the workflow table.

Change these records in the ModuleSeeker file:
```
        ModuleConvertable::insert([
        'primary_module_id' => Module::where('name', 'leads')->first()->id,
        'module_id' => Module::where('name', 'contacts')->first()->id,
        'level' => 1,
        ]);

        ModuleConvertable::insert([
            'primary_module_id' => Module::where('name', 'contacts')->first()->id,
            'module_id' => Module::where('name', 'accounts')->first()->id,
            'level' => 2,
        ]);

        ModuleConvertable::insert([
            'primary_module_id' => Module::where('name', 'accounts')->first()->id,
            'module_id' => Module::where('name', 'quotes')->first()->id,
            'level' => 3,
        ]);

        ModuleConvertable::insert([
            'primary_module_id' => Module::where('name', 'quotes')->first()->id,
            'module_id' => Module::where('name', 'opportunities')->first()->id,
            'level' => 4,
        ]);

        ModuleConvertable::insert([
            'primary_module_id' => Module::where('name', 'opportunities')->first()->id,
            'module_id' => Module::where('name', 'contracts')->first()->id,
            'level' => 5,
        ]);

        ModuleConvertable::insert([
            'primary_module_id' => Module::where('name', 'contracts')->first()->id,
            'module_id' => 0,
            'level' => 6,
        ]);
```

## Roles and Permission

IceburgCRM provides permissions by role and by module.  And allows you to set read, write, export import permissions.


## Import / Export


You have the ability to Import/Export in 6 different formats (XLSX, CSV, TSV, ODS, XLS, HTML].  Word is also available to be used but requires a system specific driver so it has been left out of the default options.



## Custom Seeding

### Files explained

These files will be run in this sequence

####  DatabaseSeeder
A database seeder file calls the remaining seeder files in sequence.  These must be run in sequence and data generated in the previous step may be required in the next step.

#### ModuleSeeder

This file creates the module records, module groups records and the module_convertable records (workflow)

#### FieldSeeder

This file creates all of the fields and relates them to modules

#### RelationshipSeeder

This file seeds the relationships between modules

#### GenerateSeeder

This file generates the default data for the modules.  It also adds the datalets, roles and permissions and any sample media.

#### ModuleSubpanelSeeder

This file generates the subpanel data.  It needs to be run last.
